Buzz me if nothing happens within 2 days :)

## keep code clean

lint your code using [prettier](https://prettier.io/)

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

\* it will report many errors relative to html tags. We know!  don't worry

# GitHub Action (deploy to server)

File: `.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml`

The following sections explain what has to be setup, how it has to be done, and what it corresponds to.

## destination

The destination is pretty clear: `user@hostname`
The port can (for the moment) be specified using a separate `-p` flag. (see ssh manual section 1)

## host key (public key)

The host key can be gotten from your `.ssh/known_hosts` file, or by using ssh-keyscan. (Note that the usual warning about verifying the key applies here, if you wanna be sure you are being MiTM-ed)
In our case, we're using an ed25519 key for the runner and host, so we only have a single line.

Note that the `SSH_DEPLOY_HOST_KEY` hostname can also be hashed. (see sshd manual section 8 for example)

This only has to be added into the GitHub secrets

## runner key (private key)

The runner key is generated using `ssh-keygen`.
Preferably a ed25519 key (-t flag).

### Setting up

As just mentioned, you want to generate your ssh key.
Once it has been generated, the content of your public key (`.pub` file) can be added into the `authorized_keys` file, while the private key is set as the secret.

Depending on your setup, you might want to change the `.ssh/authorized_keys` path.
In our case, as we use the home directory as a working directory and we delete all of the files in it, the default path of `.ssh/authorized_keys` is not appropriate.
As such, you'd want to edit your `sshd` config. For example:

```
Match User ghrunner
        AuthorizedKeysFile      /etc/ssh/keys/ghrunner
```

Note that you either wanna put this at the end of your sshd config file (as you'd otherwise apply all of the other settings listed afterwards only to the User), or in a separate file, making use of `Include`.
The `authorized_keys` file itself isn't special in any way: it is simply a file with authorized public keys on every line.

While the destination here is only a single line, the `HOST_KEY` and `RUNNER_KEY` can be multi-line. (multiple key types, multi-line key)

## Process

The workflow is split into two jobs, each job starts in a clean environment.

1. Building the site on a GitHub runner
2. Deploy built site on our server

### Deploying via SSH

The second workflow setups up SSH by:

1. Creating a `.ssh` config folder
2. Adding the server's public key into the `.ssh/known_hosts` to avoid a MiTM attack
3. Add the private key in `~/.ssh/key`

Once that is done, we can run ssh or scp with `-i ~/.ssh/key` to use that specific key, and `-q` to avoid leaking information.
