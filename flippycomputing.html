	<h2>General GNU/Linux Setup</h2>
	<p>My setup of programs is listed below.</p><br>

	<h4>GNU/Linux Distribution</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>I use Arch Linux. I like the bleeding edge nature of updating,
			and easy configuration. It definitely has a larger learning curve
			than something like Ubuntu, but once you learn the in's and out's,
			everything becomes very easy.</li>
		<li>I also dabble with FreeBSD from time to time, though I'm no expert
			and there's a lot I don't know. I'm planning on making a switch to
			OpenBSD, but until then I'll stay with FreeBSD. If you haven't tried
			the Ports system of package management, it is an absolute necessity that
			you give it a run.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Text Editor</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Vim is my text editor of choice. Like Arch, it has a learning curve but
			makes things faster overall. I particularly like the ability to search for and
			replace text, as this makes changing parts of the HTML on this website very easy.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Media Player</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>I use mpv. 'It just werks' and I don't need anything more for the rare movie
			or music album.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Window Manager</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>I use i3-wm rather than a full DE. It doesn't take up my system's
			resources, is easy to configure, and has good documentation. There are certainly
			good alternatives, herbstluftwm for example, but I don't see any point in rewriting
			all of my configurations just to have a marginal difference in performance or
			functionality.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Terminal Emulator</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>I use st. Configure once, apply scrollback.diff, never worry about
			it again. The use case of a terminal is to access the shell, so if it does that, then I
			don't care about any other feature. The most substantial reason I have for using st is that it's super
			small (~2000 lines of code) and it 'just werks.'</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Web Browser</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			I use ungoogled-chromium. It's just like normal Chromium or Chrome but without any Google integration,
			making it more secure. I use Chromium specifically because I like the functionality and UI. Simple as that.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>IRC Client</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>I use weechat. It just werks. On some computers I have irssi set up, but that's generally
			not my go-to. </li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Fonts</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>I use Cormorant Garamond for documents, and
			switch between Hack and Source Code Pro as my terminal font. I like the vintage yet clean style
			of Cormorant Garamond, and the clean readability of Source Code Pro and Hack.</li>
	</ul>
